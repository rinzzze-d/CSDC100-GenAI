        <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
        <p>The ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to carry out tasks typically associated with intelligent beings is known as artificial intelligence (AI).  The endeavor of creating systems with human-like cognitive abilities, such as the capacity for reasoning, meaning-finding, generalization, and experience-based learning, is commonly referred to by this phrase.  Since their creation in the 1940s, digital computers have been programmed to perform extremely difficult tasks—like playing chess or finding proofs for mathematical theorems—with remarkable skill.  There are currently no programs that can match human adaptability across broader fields or in activities requiring a great deal of everyday knowledge, despite ongoing advancements in computer processing speed and memory capacity.</p>

        <h1>GENERATIVE AI</h1><br>
        <p>Generative AI refers to a specialized branch of artificial intelligence focused on producing novel, previously unseen content by learning the underlying patterns and structures within large datasets. Unlike discriminative or predictive models, which categorize information or estimate probabilities, generative models synthesize new material: such as text, images, audio, or other media, that resembles human-created output. The term “generative” underscores this capacity to create original artifacts rather than merely analyze or classify existing data. Modern generative systems, including architectures like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), exemplify this capability by constructing high-quality, coherent outputs that can be consumed, interpreted, and interacted with in meaningful ways.</p>
