                <div class="collapse-title font-semibold">What is Generative AI?</div>
                <div class="collapse-content text-sm">Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content: like text, pictures, or audio. By learning from large amounts of data. Instead of just recognizing patterns or making predictions, it makes original material that didn’t exist before. Models such as GANs and VAEs are examples of generative AI because they can produce realistic, human-like results.</div>

            <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-3" />
                <div class="collapse-title font-semibold">How does it work?</div>
                <div class="collapse-content text-sm">Generative AI works by learning the underlying patterns and structure in the data it is trained on, and then using that learned representation to create new outputs that follow those same patterns. During training, the model analyzes thousands or millions of examples and builds an internal understanding of how the information is organized. Once trained, it can sample from this learned representation to generate new variations. Depending on the model type, this can mean learning to transform random noise into realistic samples, learning a compressed latent space that can be decoded into new instances, or learning to predict the next token in a sequence based on context. In every case, the process involves capturing statistical relationships in the data and recombining them to produce something new.</div>

                <div class="collapse-content text-sm"> <ol>
                    <li>1. Transformer-based models – Generate content by analyzing the full context of an input sequence, enabling coherent and context-aware text generation.</li>
                    <li>2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) – Use two networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete with each other until the generator learns to produce highly realistic synthetic data.</li>
                    <li>3. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) – Encode data into a latent space and decode it back into new variations, using built-in randomness to create diverse outputs.</li>
                    <li>4. Autoregressive models – Generate content step-by-step, predicting the next element based on previous ones.</li>
                    <li>5. Normalizing flow models – Transform simple probability distributions into more complex ones through a series of reversible mathematical operations, enabling precise control over generation.</li>

                <div class="collapse-title font-semibold">What can GenAI do (strengths)?</div>
                <div class="collapse-content text-sm">Generative AI is powerful because it can learn rich patterns from data and use them to create new, high-quality outputs that resemble real examples. This makes it extremely useful for tasks like expanding or improving datasets, enhancing images, preserving privacy through anonymized samples, and transforming content across different formats such as text, images, and audio. Its flexibility allows it to support many fields: medicine, education, software development, and more. By producing synthetic data that strengthens models, speeds up workflows, and enables creative or complex outputs. Its ability to generate original variations of learned information gives it a unique advantage over traditional AI approaches.</div>

                <div class="collapse-title font-semibold">What are its limitations or risks?</div>
                <div class="collapse-content text-sm">Generative AI can be highly useful, but it also comes with important risks. Because these systems learn from existing data, they can reproduce or even amplify biases, leading to unfair or inaccurate results. Their outputs are not always consistent or reliable, and models may confidently generate false information. They can also struggle with current or fast-changing topics if their training data is outdated. Security and misuse are additional concerns, generative AI can create convincing fake images, voices, or messages that make fraud easier. Using public AI tools may also raise privacy or data-protection issues if sensitive information is entered into the system. Copyright questions can arise as well, since training data and generated content may involve protected material. Finally, it can be difficult to assign responsibility when things go wrong, and updates to third-party AI systems may unexpectedly disrupt tools built on top of them.</div>
